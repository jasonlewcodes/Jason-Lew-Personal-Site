# Jason-Lew-Personal-Site
Welcome to my personal portfolio website!

I develop this site using JavaScript & TypeScript, HTML, CSS & TailwindCSS, React, and Gatsby hosted through GitHub Pages.

Interested in hosting the site locally? Make sure you have Gatsby installed. Run `gatsby develop` inside of this directory, and the site will be live locally at `http://localhost:8000/`.

Thanks for taking a look at my website's code!
